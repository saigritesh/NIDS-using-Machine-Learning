Securing network infrastructure has become a 
critical concern for enterprises due to the increase in cyber threats. 
Novel and complex assaults are frequently missed by conventional 
security measures like firewalls and signature-based intrusion 
detection systems. In order to solve this problem, machine 
learning-powered Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) 
have become a viable way to instantly detect and stop cyberthreats.
In order to detect anomalies, this project presents a Network 
Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) Web Interface that uses an 
ensemble model of autoencoders.The CICIDS2017 dataset, 
which includes actual assault scenarios, is used to train the system, 
enabling it to detect a wide range of intrusions with excellent 
accuracy. An interactive and user-friendly platform for tracking 
network traffic, visualizing threats found, and categorizing attack 
types is offered by the web-based interface.

The increasing number of cyber threats, such as phishing, 
malware, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, highlights the 
urgent need for strong security solutions to safeguard networks 
against unauthorized access and data breaches.

Challenges with Traditional Security Approaches: 
Standard firewall and signature-based detection systems 
frequently struggle to recognize new or changing cyber threats, 
which makes anomaly-based intrusion detection systems essential.


The proposed system aims to identify network intrusions 
and categorize attack types through an advanced machine learning 
approach. It combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), 
a deep learning model adept at processing sequential data, with 
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), a reliable machine learning algorithm 
for classification. The primary goal is to enhance the accuracy of 
intrusion detection by utilizing both deep learning and traditional 
classification techniques to effectively analyze network traffic data.
